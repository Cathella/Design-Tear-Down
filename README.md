# HTML & CSS - Design Teardown

![screenshot](./Heatmap.png)

This project involved creating a heatmap for the [Smashing Magazine home page](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) basing on what captures your eye when you first visit the page.

- We used shades of grey to implement the visibility hierachy of the page. With the darkest representing an easily seen element verses the lighter ones.
- We also added a low opacity to the child elements of the parents just to make them blended into the background of the parent elements.
